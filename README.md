### About
This is a tool for processing JSON and converting JSON arrays to [newline-delimited JSON](http://ndjson.org). 


Use it [here](https://ndjson-mcskyhcxcq-uc.a.run.app). 

### Why?
It's useful in work projects when people want filter public JSON datasets,  but can't use the command line, or are on a slow VPN.
