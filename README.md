### About
This is a tool for searching JSON and converting JSON arrays to [newline-delimited JSON](http://ndjson.org). 

It's been useful for a team that dealt with large public JSON datasets, but

1. Everyone had to work over a slow VPN or network
2. Some team members weren't able to use the command line.

Use it [here](https://ndjson-mcskyhcxcq-uc.a.run.app)!
